Let’s schedule a follow-up meeting for next Thursday.
I finally got around to cleaning out the garage last weekend.
Do you want to split the tasks to get them done faster?
I’ll check the calendar and let you know which date works best.
That sounds like a fun activity for the whole family.
We’ve been talking about taking a weekend trip to the countryside.
The new smartphone model comes with some impressive features.
I’ll let you know if anything changes with the schedule.
Let’s make sure we have everything ready ahead of time.
